    <div id="impress">
      <div id="step1" class="step slide" data-x="-1000" data-y="-1500">
          Welcome to impress.js! This is the first slide of this presentation framework. Each step of the presentation should be an element inside of a div with an id name of 'impress' and a class name of 'step'. These 'step' elements are positioned, rotated and scaled by impress.js, and the 'camera' shows them on each step of the presentation. 
        </div>

        <div id="step2" class="step slide" data-x="0" data-y="-1500">
        Positioning information is passed through data attributes. The first three steps of the presentation are not scaled or rotated. Therefore, we only specify an x and y position of these step elements. The first step was positioned with 'data-x="-1000"' and 'data-y="-1500"' attributes. This means that the center of the element (yes, the center) will be positioned in point x = -1000px and y = -1500px of the presentation 'canvas'.          
        </div>

        <div id="step3" class="step slide" data-x="1000" data-y="-1500">
          The 'id' attribute of the step element is used to identify it in the URL, but it is optional. If it is not defined, each step will get a default value of 'step-N' where N is a number of slide. The hash part of the URL when this step is active will be '#/step-2'. You can also use '#step-2' in a link, to point directly to this particular step.
        </div>

        <div id="title" class="step" data-x="0" data-y="0" data-scale="4">
          <span class="try">This is a scaled element dictated by the data attribute 'data-scale="4"'. This means that this element is 4 times larger than the others.</span>
          <h1>Title Step</h1>
          <span class="footnote">From presentation and transitions point of view it means, that it will have to be scaled down (4 times) to make it back to its correct size.</span>
